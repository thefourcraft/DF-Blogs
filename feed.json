            "content_html": "<p>SQL databases are an essential tool for many organizations, but they can also pose a significant security risk if not properly configured. One way to mitigate this risk is through the use of tunneling TCP to SQL databases.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Tunneling TCP to SQL Databases?</h2>\n<p>Tunneling TCP to SQL databases involves connecting to the database as a local host, rather than through a specific port. This can increase the security of the website or server, as every user connects in the same way. Additionally, adding single sign-on (SSO) authentication to this connection can further enhance security.</p>\n<h2>How to Set Up Tunneling TCP to SQL Databases</h2>\n<p>Setting up tunneling TCP to SQL databases is a relatively straightforward process. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign up for a Cloudflare account and add a website to it. This requires changing your domain's DNS to point to Cloudflare's nameservers.</li>\n<li>Install the Cloudflare daemon, cloudflared, on the host machine where your resource is located and on the client machines that will connect to the resource.</li>\n<li>Authenticate the Cloudflare daemon on the host machine by running the command <code>cloudflared tunnel login</code> and selecting the site where you will create a subdomain to represent the resource. Cloudflare will download a wildcard certificate for the site.</li>\n<li>Protect the subdomain with a Cloudflare Access policy to control who can connect to the resource.</li>\n<li>On the host machine, use the command <code>cloudflared tunnel --hostname [SUBDOMAIN] --url tcp://localhost:[PORT]</code> to connect the resource to Cloudflare, replacing [SUBDOMAIN] with the desired subdomain and [PORT] with the port number of the resource. Make sure to configure the process to stay alive and autostart.</li>\n<li>On the client machines, use the command <code>cloudflared access tcp --hostname [SUBDOMAIN] --url localhost:[PORT]</code> to create a connection from the device to Cloudflare, replacing [SUBDOMAIN] with the subdomain of the resource and [PORT] with an available port on the client machine. You can create a desktop shortcut to make it easier for end users to connect.</li>\n<li>Have the client application connect to the port specified on the client machine. When the client launches, Cloudflare will launch a browser window and prompt the user to authenticate with the SSO provider.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By following these steps, you can set up tunneling TCP to SQL databases and increase the security of your website or server.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>SQL databases are a vital tool for many organizations, but they can also be a significant security risk if not properly configured. One way to enhance security is through the use of tunneling TCP to SQL databases, which involves connecting to the database as a local host and adding SSO authentication. By following the steps outlined above, you can set up tunneling TCP to SQL databases and increase the security of your website or server.</p>\n<p> </p>",
