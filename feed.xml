                <p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:209">The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) has been a fundamental part of CPython's design for decades. However, a new era is dawning for Python developers, with the possibility of building CPython without the GIL.</p>

<h2>Introduction to GIL</h2>
<p>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. While it simplifies the implementation, it has been a bottleneck for multi-threaded applications.</p>
<h3>Overview of CPython Changes</h3>
<p>Removing the GIL requires substantial changes to CPython internals, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference Counting</strong>: Making reference counting thread-safe.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Replacing the internal allocator with a thread-safe one.</li>
<li><strong>Container Thread-Safety</strong>: Using per-object locks for containers like lists and dictionaries.</li>
<li><strong>Garbage Collection</strong>: Modifications to support the new structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Memory Management</h2>
<p>The proposal includes replacing pymalloc with mimalloc, a general-purpose thread-safe allocator. This change also addresses issues related to garbage collection and container thread-safety.</p>
<h2>Garbage Collection (Cycle Collection)</h2>
<p>The garbage collector will require significant changes, including using "stop-the-world" to provide thread-safety and eliminating generational garbage collection.</p>
<h3>The Historical Context of GIL</h3>
<p>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) has been a part of Python since 1992, a year after Python's public release. During the early '90s, multi-core CPUs were not common, and the GIL was an effective solution to share the interpreter between different operating system threads. Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, reflected on the era, stating that the GIL became infamous when chip designers began putting multiple CPUs on one chip, leading to pressure for parallel processing.</p>
<h3>Why GIL Was Retained</h3>
<p>Several factors influenced the GIL's retention in Python. It was easy to implement, and single-thread programs worked fast. The GIL also prevented certain bugs, such as deadlocks, that could occur with fine-grained locks. However, similar to Linux's big kernel lock and FreeBSD's giant lock, the GIL only allowed one thread to be processed at a time, limiting efficiency.</p>
<h3>The Push to Remove GIL</h3>
<p>With the rise of neural network-based AI models and the need to exploit multiple types of parallelism, the GIL became a significant drawback. In languages other than Python, threads can run different parts of an AI model in separate CPU cores. The GIL's presence in Python blocked this possibility, leading to a growing consensus for its removal. A poll conducted by the Python team last month gauged the community's support for free threading and PEP 703, leading to the official acceptance of the proposal to remove the GIL.</p>
<h3>A Cautious Approach to GIL Removal</h3>
<p>The process of removing the GIL is long and cautious. The Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) introduces a new build configuration flag to disable the GIL in CPython. The proposal is divided into short-term, mid-term, and long-term stages, with the GIL-free version eventually becoming the default Python interpreter. This transformation is seen as a win for the AI ecosystem and is led by Sam Gross, with Meta dedicating a serious engineering team to the effort.</p>
<h3>Impact on Other Languages</h3>
<p>An exciting outcome of Python's move towards a GIL-less future is its potential impact on other languages like Rust. Developers who previously turned to Rust for multi-threaded computation may now find Python without the GIL viable. This shift could lead to broader adoption of Python in areas where the GIL was previously a limitation.</p>
<h3>Multi-Threading with GIL</h3>
<p>With the GIL in place, multi-threading in Python can be restrictive. Even though you can create multiple threads, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. Here's a simple example of multi-threading with the GIL:</p>
<div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4">
<div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"> </div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> threading
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> time

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">print_numbers</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>):
        time.sleep(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(i)

<span class="hljs-comment"># Creating two threads</span>
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)

<span class="hljs-comment"># Starting the threads</span>
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

<span class="hljs-comment"># Waiting for both threads to complete</span>
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the GIL, the threads don't truly run in parallel, leading to suboptimal performance on multi-core processors.</p>
<h3>GIL Removal and True Parallelism</h3>
<p>Without the GIL, Python can achieve true parallelism, allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously on different CPU cores. This can lead to significant performance improvements in CPU-bound tasks. Here's an example of how code might benefit from GIL removal:</p>
<div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4">
<div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"> </div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> concurrent.futures <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ThreadPoolExecutor

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">compute_heavy_task</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>):
    <span class="hljs-comment"># Simulating a CPU-bound task</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> x * x

<span class="hljs-comment"># Using a thread pool to run tasks in parallel</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> ThreadPoolExecutor() <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> executor:
    results = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(executor.<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(compute_heavy_task, <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1000</span>)))

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(results)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Without the GIL, this code can utilize all available CPU cores, leading to faster execution.</p>
<h3>Impact on Reference Counting</h3>
<p>Removing the GIL requires reference counting changes to make it thread-safe. Here's a simplified example of how reference counting might be implemented without the GIL:</p>
<div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4">
<div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"> </div>
<blockquote>
<pre class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> _<span class="hljs-title">object</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-type">uintptr_t</span> ob_tid; <span class="hljs-comment">// owning thread id</span>
  <span class="hljs-type">uint32_t</span> ob_ref_local; <span class="hljs-comment">// local reference count for the owning thread</span>
  Py_ssize_t ob_ref_shared; <span class="hljs-comment">// shared reference count for other threads</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
};

<span class="hljs-comment">// Incrementing the reference count</span>
<span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">INCREF</span><span class="hljs-params">(PyObject *obj)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj-&gt;ob_tid == current_thread_id()) {
    obj-&gt;ob_ref_local++;
  } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    atomic_increment(&amp;obj-&gt;ob_ref_shared);
  }
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This example illustrates how reference counting can be adapted to support multi-threading without the GIL, using a combination of local and shared reference counts.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://blog.thefourcraft.com/media/posts/62/Minecraft-Mayhem-The-BleedingPipe-Exploit.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>A new exploit has been spotted in the wild, enabling complete remote code execution (RCE) on clients and servers running popular Minecraft mods on 1.7.10/1.12.2 Forge.</p>

<p class="msg msg--warning">It's crucial to understand that this vulnerability doesn't stem from Forge itself but mods that employ unsafe deserialization code.</p>
<h2>The Vulnerable Mods</h2>
<p>Several mods have been pinpointed as susceptible to the BleedingPipe exploit. These include EnderCore, LogisticsPipes, BDLib, Smart Moving 1.12, Brazier, DankNull, and Gadomancy. It's imperative for both players and server administrators to either update these mods or remove them entirely to reduce the risk.</p>
<h2>Tracing the Origins</h2>
<p>The Java community has been aware of this kind of vulnerability, often termed as a deserialization attack or gadget chain, for quite some time. The first indications of this exploit within the Minecraft modding community can be traced back to March 2022, when a vulnerability in ObjectInputStream was hinted at on BDLib’s GitHub. The issue remained dormant until it resurfaced in July 2023, leading to widespread awareness and subsequent patching efforts.</p>
<h2>The Exploitation Surge</h2>
<p>Post the initial discovery, it was revealed that a malicious actor had scanned all Minecraft servers on the IPv4 address space to exploit vulnerable servers on a large scale. The exact contents of the exploit and its potential impact on other clients remain unknown.</p>
<h2>Protective Measures</h2>
<p>The ambiguity surrounding the exploit's payload makes detection a challenging task. However, server admins are advised to search for suspicious files and run malware detection tools like jSus or jNeedle on all installed mods. Conversely, players should conduct antivirus scans and check for suspicious files in their .minecraft directory.</p>
<h2>Mitigating the Threat</h2>
<p>Updating EnderIO or LogisticsPipes to the latest CurseForge versions is recommended to mitigate the risk. For BDLib users, a migration to the GT New Horizons fork is suggested. The PipeBlocker mod can also be installed on forge servers and clients for general mitigation.</p>
<h2>A Technical Examination</h2>
<p>The root cause of the BleedingPipe exploits lies in the use of ObjectInputStream for networking code in the affected mods. This sends packets with malicious serialization, enabling any code to be run on the server, which can then infect all clients.</p>
<pre><code>// Hypothetical example of vulnerable code
public class VulnerableClass {
    public void executeCommand(String command) {
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <code>executeCommand</code> method is vulnerable to RCE because it executes any command it receives without any validation or sanitization. This is a simplified example; actual vulnerabilities can be much more complex and harder to spot.</p>
<div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4">
<pre class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><code>// Hypothetical example of a secure code
public class SecureClass {
    public void executeCommand(String command) {
        if (isValidCommand(command)) {
            try {
                Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean isValidCommand(String command) {
        // Implement validation logic here
        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<div>In the secure code version, the <code>executeCommand</code> method checks if the command is valid before executing it. This basic form of input validation can help prevent RCE attacks.</div>
<div>
<p>The BleedingPipe exploit is another stark reminder of the ever-present threats in the digital landscape, even in seemingly innocuous environments like Minecraft modding. It underscores the importance of vigilance, regular updates, and secure coding practices.</p>
<p>While the exploit is not a flaw in Forge itself, it has exposed vulnerabilities in several mods that use unsafe deserialization code. The affected mods include EnderCore, LogisticsPipes, BDLib, and others. Players and server administrators must stay informed about such vulnerabilities and take immediate action, such as updating or removing vulnerable mods.</p>
<p>The exploit also highlights the importance of secure coding practices. As the code examples demonstrate, input validation is a simple yet effective way to prevent remote code execution attacks. Developers must always be mindful of potential security risks and implement measures to mitigate them.</p>
<p>In the face of such threats, the Minecraft community has shown resilience and quick response. The discovery and subsequent awareness of the exploit have led to patching efforts and the development of mitigation measures like the PipeBlocker mod. This collective response is a testament to the strength and resourcefulness of the community.</p>
<p class="align-left">The BleedingPipe exploit is a significant security concern, but its impact can be mitigated with awareness, vigilance, and proactive measures. As we continue to enjoy the creativity and fun of Minecraft modding, let's also remember to prioritize security and protect our digital spaces.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many aspects of our lives, and the field of software development is no exception. One of the most prominent AI models in this space is ChatGPT. While it has proven to be a powerful tool for generating human-like text, it has also shown a tendency to "hallucinate" or generate information that doesn't exist. This behavior has significant implications, especially when recommending software dependencies.</p>

<h2>The Phenomenon of AI Hallucination</h2>
<p>AI hallucination is a phenomenon where AI models generate outputs that are plausible but not based on factual reality. This is particularly prevalent in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which have been trained on vast amounts of text data. These models can generate creative yet unexpected responses that may not align with factual reality<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In software development, one of the most concerning forms of AI hallucination is when ChatGPT recommends software packages or dependencies that do not exist. This behavior, known as "AI package hallucination," can pose significant security risks<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h2>The Risks of AI Package Hallucination</h2>
<p>The problem with AI package hallucination is twofold. First, it can lead developers to waste time and resources trying to integrate non-existent packages into their projects. Second, and more concerning, it can open the door for malicious actors to exploit this behavior.</p>
<p>Here it works: an attacker can ask ChatGPT for a package to solve a coding problem. <br>If ChatGPT recommends a non-existent package, the attacker can then create a malicious package with the same name and publish it to a package repository. <br>When a developer later asks ChatGPT a similar question, they may receive a recommendation to use the now-existing malicious package.</p>
<p>This attack technique, dubbed "AI package hallucination," presents a significant security risk. It bypasses traditional security measures to detect suspicious activities like typosquatting or masquerading, making it harder to detect and prevent.</p>
<h2>Mitigating the Risks</h2>
<p>Given the potential risks associated with AI package hallucination, developers must thoroughly vet the packages they use. This is especially important when using tools like ChatGPT, which may recommend non-existent or malicious packages.</p>
<p>Developers can mitigate these risks by checking the creation date of the package, the number of downloads, comments, and any attached notes. If anything looks suspicious, it's best to think twice before installing the package.</p>

<h2>The Outage Begins</h2>
<p>The day they started like any other Tuesday. However, at approximately 10:30 AM Eastern Time, things began to go awry in Amazon's North Virginia region, known as "us-east-1". Over the next three minutes, several regional AWS services started experiencing issues. This wasn't a complete outage for all these services. Still, their functionality was significantly impaired, causing a ripple effect that disrupted the operations of many businesses and services relying on AWS.</p>
<p>The services affected included the Management console, Route 53, API Gateway, EventBridge, Amazon Connect, and EC2. The outage affected all availability zones in us-east-1 and disrupted a number of global services that are homed in this region. This included AWS Account root logins, Single Sign-On (SSO), and the Security Token Service (STS).</p>
<h2>Event Timeline </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>7:30 AM PST</strong>: An automated activity to scale capacity of one of the AWS services triggered an unexpected behavior, resulting in a significant surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the leading AWS network. This caused delays in communication between these networks, leading to increased latency and errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>9:28 AM PST</strong>: AWS teams completed work on moving the internal DNS traffic away from the congested network paths, which resulted in the complete recovery of DNS resolution errors. This improved the availability of several impacted services by reducing the load on the impacted networking devices but did not fully resolve the AWS service impact or eliminate the congestion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1:34 PM PST</strong>: Congestion significantly improved as the operations teams applied remediation actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2:22 PM PST</strong>: All network devices fully recovered. However, full recovery for Amazon Secure Token Service (STS) occurred at 4:28 PM PST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4:37 PM PST</strong>: API Gateway largely recovered, but customers may have continued to experience low errors and throttling for several hours as API Gateways fully stabilized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5:00 PM PST</strong>: Fargate API error rates began returning to normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6:40 PM PST</strong>: EventBridge experienced high event delivery latency until this time as it processed the backlog of events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The impact of the outage was broad and far-reaching. It caused various problems for services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Roomba, Ticketmaster, and the Wall Street Journal. It also affected many Amazon services, including Prime Music, Ring doorbells, logistics apps in their fulfillment centers, and some parts of the Amazon.com shopping site.</p>
<p>The outage highlighted the interconnectedness of digital services and the potential domino effect that can occur when a primary cloud service provider experiences issues. It was a stark reminder of the potential risks of relying heavily on a single cloud service provider.</p>
<h2>The Root Cause</h2>
<p>After the dust settled, AWS provided a detailed explanation of what had caused the outage. The root cause was an unexpected behavior triggered by an automated system trying to scale up an internal service running on AWS's private internal network. This led to a significant surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the leading AWS network, resulting in delays in communication between these networks.</p>
<p>These delays increased latency and errors for services communicating between these networks, leading to persistent congestion and performance issues on the devices connecting the two networks. This congestion immediately impacted the availability of real-time monitoring data for AWS's internal operations teams, which impaired their ability to find and resolve the source of congestion.</p>
<h2>The Aftermath and Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The outage had a significant impact on AWS's reputation. However, it also provided valuable lessons for AWS and its users. AWS has since taken several actions to prevent a recurrence of this event. They have turned off the scaling activities that triggered the event and are working on fixing a latent issue that prevented their systems from adequately backing off during the event.</p>
<p>This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of designing robust and resilient systems. It also underscores the need for effective communication during operational issues. AWS has acknowledged the need to improve customer communication during such events and is planning significant upgrades.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>While the AWS outage was a significant event that caused widespread disruption, it also provided valuable lessons. It highlighted the importance of resilience in system design and the need for effective communication during operational issues. As AWS continues to learn from this event and improve its systems, users can also take this opportunity to evaluate their systems and consider how they can enhance their resilience to such events in the future.</p>
<p>In the world of cloud computing, outages are inevitable. However, they can be mitigated through robust system design, effective communication, and continuous learning from past incidents. The December 2021 AWS outage was a stark reminder of this reality. As we progress, cloud service providers and users must take these lessons to heart, continually striving to improve system resilience and response strategies.</p>

<p>As the CTO at <a href="https://ims-network.org" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMS - Network</a>, I have spearheaded implementing a robust hybrid multi-cloud solution for our applications and services. Our infrastructure strategy combines utilizing major cloud providers with managing two physical server farms in Israel. By adopting this approach, our primary objective is to optimize costs and achieve cost savings. We evaluate the most cost-effective options for each application or platform we develop or host. This approach allows us to leverage the advantages of cloud services while maintaining control over specific resources, ensuring flexibility, reliability, and cost efficiency for our organization.</p>
<h2>Why Did I Choose AWS For This Platform</h2>
<p>When I initially started developing "גיימינג.ישראל," it was a simple Docker application running on my local PC. Initially, I built the platform from scratch using the <a href="https://Frappeframework.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frappe framework</a>. While Frappe is a fantastic framework to work with, I soon realized that this approach would be time-consuming and require significant effort. After two months of development, I decided to transition to <a href="https://WordPress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress</a>. WordPress is a well-known platform with extensive documentation, an active community, and a robust foundation.</p>
<p>The shift to AWS came when we at IMS - Network began migrating applications from our self-hosted servers to the cloud. The primary goal was to free up space on our servers to accommodate gaming servers, as low ping is a critical factor for gamers. <br>We recognized that AWS offered a comprehensive suite of services, scalability, reliability, and the ability to optimize costs. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice to utilize AWS for "גיימינג.ישראל" was driven by the need for a scalable and reliable platform, and the desire to streamline development efforts.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure Setup</h2>
<p>Our infrastructure consists of several vital services within the AWS environment. Here are details about the services we utilize:</p>

<h3>EC2 – Automatic Scaling and System Operations</h3>
<p>Our system operates on two EC2 instances that host our platform. With the automatic scaling feature of EC2, we can dynamically adjust our resources in response to changes in system load. This capability allows us to efficiently handle varying workloads and maintain optimal availability and performance for our users.</p>
<p>When the demand for our system increases, EC2 automatically scales up our resources by adding more instances to handle the workload effectively. Likewise, during periods of lower demand, EC2 scales down our resources by removing instances, optimizing cost efficiency.</p>
<h3>S3 – Daily Image Backup</h3>
<div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3">
<div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark">
<p>We have implemented the S3 (Simple Storage Service) as our backup solution to safeguard our valuable images. Through S3, we store and protect our images in a secure and easily accessible manner. This approach ensures that our images are reliably backed up and can be swiftly recovered in the event of data loss or system failure. By leveraging S3's durability and redundancy features, we maintain the integrity of our image data, guaranteeing that important visual content is preserved and readily available whenever needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3">
<div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark">
<p>To streamline communication within our system, we rely on the SES (Simple Email Service) provided by Amazon for efficient email delivery. By leveraging SES, we can automate the process of sending emails and notifications to users within our system. This service serves as a reliable and swift communication channel, enabling us to effectively deliver important information and timely updates to our users. With SES, we ensure that our users receive essential messages promptly and dependably, facilitating seamless and effective communication throughout our platform.</p>

<div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark">
<p>We have integrated the API Gateway service into our infrastructure to effectively manage both the WordPress API and our unique platform API. API Gateway is vital in securely handling communication with the APIs, ensuring easy administration and maintenance. This service provides a centralized control point for our APIs, allowing us to manage access, authentication, and rate limiting efficiently. Moreover, API Gateway empowers us to develop external applications that can seamlessly interact with our system through the custom API, fostering integrations and extending the functionality of our platform.</p>

<div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark">
<p>Within our infrastructure, we have integrated the RDS (Relational Database Service) offered by AWS, with MySQL serving as the primary database for our WordPress-based system. By utilizing RDS, we benefit from a fully managed database solution, enabling us to dedicate our resources to developing and maintaining our application without concern with setting up central server infrastructures or managing the database locally. RDS provides a reliable and scalable foundation for our database needs, ensuring optimal performance and streamlined management.</p>
<h3>EOF</h3>
<p>In general, the combination of AWS infrastructure and WordPress allowed me to build גיימינג.ישראל and make it work :)  </p>
<h4>Why won't you go multi-region in case Frankfurt won't be available?</h4>
<div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]">
<div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto">
<div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]">
<div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3">
<div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark">
<p>Well, here's a light-hearted response with a DevOps joke:</p>
<p>"Why won't you go multi-region in case Frankfurt won't be available? Because our budget is more single-region than multi-million!"</p>
<p>In the world of DevOps, multi-region setups are often considered the gold standard for high availability and disaster recovery. However, implementing such a setup can be costly and resource-intensive. So, while the idea of going multi-region might be appealing, sometimes the budget constraints make it a challenging endeavor. But hey, we can always dream of a day when our pockets are as vast as our infrastructure!</p>

<h2>Hold On... How's The Domain Name In Hebrew!?</h2>
<p>The new Country Code top-level domain (ccTLD) .ישראל has launched! On November 22, 2022, the Israel Internet Association (ISOC-IL) started offering the public the option to register Hebrew domain names under a new national TLD – .ישראל. Now, Israelis have two available TLDs: ישראל and .il.</p>
<p>Notably, while the ability to register a .ישראל domain is exciting, it's important to note that not all web apps and online services may support it initially. ISOC-IL is actively working to expand the support for the new TLD in various apps and platforms. Still, this process will take time due to the many browsers, messaging apps, online services, and email apps available.</p>
<h3>How do non-Latin domain names work?</h3>
<p>Domain names in Hebrew (and other languages) utilize a set of standards called IDN (Internationalized Domain Names). Hebrew domain names are translated into strings containing Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens, decoded by the domain name system (DNS). For example, the domain name "גיימינג.ישראל" is represented as "xn--6dbauaa3ap.xn--4dbrk0ce". While many browsers already support IDN standards, email software, and other applications still adopt them.</p>
<h3>Wait... How Did You Manage To Acquire The Domain Name "gaming.Israel"</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that "גיימינג.ישראל" translates to "gaming.Israel," which is a precious domain, similar to domains like gaming.com or apple.com. Acquiring such a domain requires registering during the sunrise period:</p>
<h4>What is the sunrise period for a new gTLD?</h4>
<p>When a new gTLD is launched, a <strong>sunrise period of at least 30 days is required before domain names are offered to the general public</strong> During the Sunrise period, you can register a domain name for 1 to 10 years, depending on the registry rules</p>
<h4>So How Did I Buy "גיימינג.ישראל"</h4>
<p>During the sunrise period, many large enterprises typically reserve their domains. However, individuals and organizations also seek unique names to purchase for future use. The same held true for the new gTLD domain, .ישראל.</p>
<p>When I first heard about the new gTLD, I was eager to acquire "גיימינג.ישראל" right from the start. Without hesitation, I promptly approached a verified domain registrar and engaged in a bidding war with one of the prominent telecommunication providers in Israel. After numerous rounds of bidding, I emerged victorious! 😈</p>
<h2>About The "גיימינג.ישראל" Platform</h2>
<p>The motivation behind creating the "גיימינג.ישראל" platform stemmed from a desire to address several challenges faced by the Israeli gaming community. As a player and a gaming community owner, I noticed that the community was fragmented due to the lack of a centralized platform where players could quickly discover and join various gaming communities in Israel.</p>
<p>Existing server lists in other countries often proved to be complicated to navigate, had poor design, or lacked adequate security measures. Additionally, many Israeli gamers resorted to seeking gaming communities in the US or EU due to the absence of a comprehensive platform in Israel. However, the major obstacle they faced was the issue of high ping, which negatively impacted their gaming experience when playing on servers located far away.</p>
<p>With the "גיימינג.ישראל" platform, I aimed to provide a solution that would address these challenges and unite the Israeli gaming community. Players can easily find and join gaming servers within Israel by offering a user-friendly and secure platform. This enhances the gaming experience and fosters a stronger sense of community among Israeli gamers.</p>
<p>Through "גיימינג.ישראל," gamers can discover a wide range of local gaming communities, connect with fellow players, and engage in thrilling adventures unique to Israel. By eliminating the ping issue associated with distant servers, the platform enables Israeli gamers to embrace and enjoy gaming experiences within their own country fully.</p>
<p>The vision behind "גיימינג.ישראל" is to create a vibrant and unified gaming ecosystem in Israel, where players can effortlessly explore, connect, and collaborate. Together, we can build a strong and thriving gaming community that showcases the talent and creativity of Israeli gamers to the world. Join us on "גיימינג.ישראל" and unlock the full potential of gaming in Israel!</p>
