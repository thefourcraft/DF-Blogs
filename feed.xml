                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">As a Minecraft Java developer, you will inevitably encounter bugs and issues while creating your plugins.<br>Debugging and troubleshooting these issues can be a challenging and time-consuming process, but there are several best practices that can help make it more efficient and effective.</p>

<h3>Use a debugger</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful tools at your disposal for debugging Java-based Minecraft plugins is a debugger. <br>A debugger allows you to pause the execution of your code at specific points, inspect variables and their values, and step through your code line by line. <br>This can be extremely useful for identifying the root cause of a bug or issue.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use a debugger in Eclipse, a popular Java development environment:</p>
<pre><code>Copy code// Set a breakpoint at this line of code
int x = 5;

// Run your code in debug mode
// The debugger will stop at the breakpoint
System.out.println(x);

// Use the debugger to inspect the value of x
// You can also step through your code line by line
// to see how it is executing
</code></pre>
<h3>Use log messages</h3>
<p>Another effective technique for debugging Java-based Minecraft plugins is to use log messages. <br>By adding log messages to your code at various points, you can see how it is executing and identify any issues that may arise.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use log messages in your Java code:</p>
<pre><code>Copy code// Import the logging library
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;

// Add a log message
Bukkit.getLogger().info("This is a log message");

// You can also use log messages to print the values of variables
int x = 5;
Bukkit.getLogger().info("The value of x is: " + x);
</code></pre>
<h3>Use test cases</h3>
<p>Another helpful technique for debugging Java-based Minecraft plugins is to use test cases. <br>By creating test cases that exercise specific aspects of your code, you can isolate and debug specific issues more easily.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use test cases in your Java code:</p>
<pre><code>Copy code// Import the testing library
import org.junit.Test;

// Create a test case
@Test
public void testExample() {
  // Add your test code here
  // You can use assertions to verify that your code is behaving as expected
  assertTrue(5 == 5);
}
</code></pre>
<p>By following these best practices, you can significantly improve your ability to debug and troubleshoot Java-based Minecraft plugins. Don't be afraid to experiment and try different approaches to see what works best for you and your specific needs.</p>
<p>I hope this information is helpful, and happy debugging!</p>

                <p>SQL databases are an essential tool for many organizations, but they can also pose a significant security risk if not properly configured. One way to mitigate this risk is through the use of tunneling TCP to SQL databases.</p>

<h2>What is Tunneling TCP to SQL Databases?</h2>
<p>Tunneling TCP to SQL databases involves connecting to the database as a local host, rather than through a specific port. This can increase the security of the website or server, as every user connects in the same way. Additionally, adding single sign-on (SSO) authentication to this connection can further enhance security.</p>
<h2>How to Set Up Tunneling TCP to SQL Databases</h2>
<p>Setting up tunneling TCP to SQL databases is a relatively straightforward process. Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a Cloudflare account and add a website to it. This requires changing your domain's DNS to point to Cloudflare's nameservers.</li>
<li>Install the Cloudflare daemon, cloudflared, on the host machine where your resource is located and on the client machines that will connect to the resource.</li>
<li>Authenticate the Cloudflare daemon on the host machine by running the command <code>cloudflared tunnel login</code> and selecting the site where you will create a subdomain to represent the resource. Cloudflare will download a wildcard certificate for the site.</li>
<li>Protect the subdomain with a Cloudflare Access policy to control who can connect to the resource.</li>
<li>On the host machine, use the command <code>cloudflared tunnel --hostname [SUBDOMAIN] --url tcp://localhost:[PORT]</code> to connect the resource to Cloudflare, replacing [SUBDOMAIN] with the desired subdomain and [PORT] with the port number of the resource. Make sure to configure the process to stay alive and autostart.</li>
<li>On the client machines, use the command <code>cloudflared access tcp --hostname [SUBDOMAIN] --url localhost:[PORT]</code> to create a connection from the device to Cloudflare, replacing [SUBDOMAIN] with the subdomain of the resource and [PORT] with an available port on the client machine. You can create a desktop shortcut to make it easier for end users to connect.</li>
<li>Have the client application connect to the port specified on the client machine. When the client launches, Cloudflare will launch a browser window and prompt the user to authenticate with the SSO provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can set up tunneling TCP to SQL databases and increase the security of your website or server.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>SQL databases are a vital tool for many organizations, but they can also be a significant security risk if not properly configured. One way to enhance security is through the use of tunneling TCP to SQL databases, which involves connecting to the database as a local host and adding SSO authentication. By following the steps outlined above, you can set up tunneling TCP to SQL databases and increase the security of your website or server.</p>

                <h2>What is log4shell?</h2>
<p>The Log4Shell problem is a security problem that was discovered in Java software. <br>The problem affects servers in the world around the world. <br>Since December 10, 2021, days after industry experts discovered the Log4Shell flaw in servers supporting the Minecraft game.<br><br>According to one team tracking the impact.<br>The vulnerability is a potential threat to millions of other applications and devices worldwide.<br><br>In the days following the announcement of the vulnerability, Check Point tracked millions of attacks initiated by people, with some research studies at a rate of over a hundred attacks per minute, which ultimately resulted in over 40% of the world's business networks being attacked.<br><br>Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince says evidence of use or apparent testing of the vulnerability was seen as early as December 1, nine days before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed.</p>
<h3>Why We Closed Our Minecraft Servers Immediately?</h3>
<p>Our security system and some functions in the Minecraft game were at risk from abuse and damage to our quality and security capabilities.<br>Minecraft is the source where the vulnerability was discovered.</p>
<h3>The Aftermath</h3>
<p>We had to update and change a lot of the source code for our in-game security system<br>and manually update 100k files to meet the new security system configurations.<br>while some of the poses were automatic we still had to do a lot of work by hand<br>also, all other plugins and servers had to be updated to the new server software that has been released to fix log4shell</p>
<h3>Long Days</h3>
<p>me and our small server team, worked around the clock for a week to fix the issue on all servers and update over 200K lines of code, 200+ plugins, and over 500K configuration files.<br>This is not even counting the sheer number of hours spent on testing the security of the new system and figuring out different compatibility issues.<br>As a mature DevOps engineer, it was kind of my first major skill check.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <h2>What Is A .ml domain?</h2>
<p>The domain(.ml) was initially managed by Sotelma, a Malian telecommunications company.<br>After Selma was privatized in 2009, the .ml zone was redelegated by IANA to the Agence des Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (AGETIC), a Malian government agency, and the process was completed in 2013.<br><br>The agency then announced that it would give away <i>.ml</i> domains for free with a view to improving the usage and knowledge of the IT industry in Mali. <br>It is the first African nation to start giving away domains for free.<br><br>However, people outside of Africa and registry companies took advantage of this and started offering free domains.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup></p>
<h2>Why Using A Free Domain Bad?</h2>
<p>free domains are not granted that you will keep them, because the domains are free you often find them unsafe and unreliable.</p>
<h3>Freenom | Stay Away From It</h3>
<p>With Freenom offering free domains to help people enter the online world with ease, an obvious question arises about its safety. If you are also curious to know whether is Freenom safe or not, I’d like to share that <strong>it is not safe and involves a lot of risks</strong>.</p>
<p>The foremost risk factor involved in getting a free domain from Freenom is the termination of your domain at any moment. This leads to a waste of all your time and efforts spent on the free domain.</p>
<p>In my web development journey, I’ve seen many horror stories of people who blindly believed this free domain gimmick of Freenom, only to be surprised later with their domain/account terminated.</p>
<p>So I’ve researched deeply about this free offering from Freenom to bring a detailed review of its services. Hopefully, this article will help you know what to expect in advance when you are about to use a Freenom domain.</p>
<p>In this article, I address all the safety aspects of a Freenom domain, the legality of Freenom, and any hidden costs involved when taking up a free domain. You will get to know how the company makes money without charging you for the domain.</p>
<h2><span id="Is_Freenom_safe">Is Freenom Safe?</span></h2>
<p>To put it shortly <strong>NO. <br></strong>The safety of a free domain from Freenom is truly questionable. <br>In my opinion, the domain that you register with Freenom is not safe at all since you are not the owner of the domain. <br>The <strong>company owns your domain and has complete control over it.</strong></p>
<p>You are always at the risk of losing all the resources and time that you invested into the website, without any prior warning since <strong>Freenom owns your domain and can take it over whenever it wants</strong>. <br>And with <strong>no legal rights to your domain</strong>, you will be left with no option to claim it.</p>
<p><strong>Freenom </strong>also has an automatic traffic analyzer that observes traffic flow at the domains it registers. <br><strong>The company can cancel your domain name if it is not getting any traffic</strong> over some time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when your domain starts receiving a good amount of traffic, the company might mark your domain as “<strong>Fraud</strong>” and <strong>steal it from you</strong>. <br>It can redirect your website users to another page filled with online advertisements all over.</p>
<p>You will be surprised to know that even the paid domains registered with Freenom are also unreliable.<br>The company resells your domain to the person paying extra money.</p>
<h2><span id="Is_Freenom_legit_legally">Is Freenom Legit Legally?</span></h2>
<p>Freenom is a fraud company in the manner it conducts its domain registration business.</p>
<p>You will be surprised to know that Freenom had its <strong>ICANN registrar accreditation suspended in 2015 for cybersquatting</strong> rival companies. <br>The suspension was, however, later lifted.</p>
<p>That being said, the company is now backed by Kima Ventures, a reputed French venture capital firm.<br>So, for now, it is in safe hands and can be trusted a little for the time being.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Alternative_to_Freenom">Best Alternative To Freenom</span></h2>
<p>Cloudflare is your best choice.<br>Securely register new domains, transfer existing domains, and effortlessly consolidate and manage all your domain portfolios, with transparent, no-markup pricing. <br>Eliminate surprise renewal fees and hidden add-on charges.</p>
<p>Cloudflare Registrar supports common top-level domains (TLDs) including .com, .net, .org, as well as hundreds more.</p>
<h5>Custom Domain Protection with Cloudflare</h5>
<p>Custom Domain Protection, a Cloudflare Registrar feature available on the Enterprise Plan, is the highest level of registrar security.<br>It protects your organization from domain hijacking with high-touch, on, and offline verification of any changes to your Registrar account. <br>Cloudflare is an ICANN accredited registrar providing secure domain registration for high-profile domains.</p>
<h2>What Happened To isrealmincraft.ml</h2>
<p>When we just got started with servers and managing we used a domain name from Freenom which was taken away from us, because of "fraud".<br>at first, I didn't catch the issue and didn't understand why people can't connect to our server, after talking with Cloudflare's support we made to the conclusion that Freenom caused all the problems.</p>
