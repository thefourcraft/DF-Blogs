                <p>In the world of online gaming, server infrastructure is a critical component. As players, we often take the technology that makes our online adventures possible for granted. Today, we will examine a service revolutionizing how we think about gaming servers: <a href="https://playit.gg" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">playit.gg</a>.</p>

<h2>What is playit.gg?</h2>
<p>playit.gg is a forward-thinking service allowing anyone to create free secure gaming servers. In a world where the cost of maintaining infrastructure can hinder creative endeavors, playit.gg steps up to provide an invaluable resource to the gaming community.</p>
<p>The platform is not just about cost savings, though. It's also about security, reliability, and performance. And this is where our technical deep dive begins: with the magic of an anycast network.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="info-section margin-top">
<p>playit.gg is a networking service that make it possible to host game servers at home that anyone across the world can join. We do this through our custom tunneling software. You can find our opensource client <a href="https://playit.gg/about" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. When you launch the playit program, the program will connect to our Anycast Network and assign you a static IP and port. You can then share your static IP and port with friends. When they connect, their connection information will go to the nearest tunnel server and be tunneled to the playit program running on your computer. By tunneling the connection, your friend is able to connect to the server running within your network.</p>
<p>From the About page on the website :) </p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is an Anycast network?</h2>
<p>Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology that enables routing inbound requests to different locations, depending on factors like congestion, distance, and link health. In the context of DevOps and network management, anycast offers tremendous advantages.</p>
<p>In a conventional unicast network, a single IP address is tied to a single device. An IP address can be assigned to multiple devices with anycast, typically servers distributed across different geographical locations. When a user requests an anycast IP address, network protocols determine the best path to one of these servers, usually the closest or least congested.</p>
<p>This has several implications for system resilience and performance. Anycast networks can handle heavy traffic loads, automatically routing around congestion and spreading demand across multiple servers. They can also improve latency, as users are routed to the nearest server.</p>
<p>In addition, anycast networks can enhance security. For example, in the event of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, the traffic can be distributed across multiple servers, reducing the risk of any single server being overwhelmed. This is especially important for a gaming service like playit.gg, which needs to maintain uptime and performance even in the face of potential cyberattacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Anycast Network is a network where all of our IP addresses are available at all of our datacenters. When you or a player tries to communicate with a playit tunnel server, your ISP will route your connection to what they consider is the closet datacenter we operate in. ISPs don't always get this right so we're actively working of a new ways to improve this.</p>
<p>From the About page on the website :) </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to use playit.gg?</h2>
<p>Using playit.gg is straightforward. After signing up for an account, you can create your gaming server by following the prompts on the website. You can customize your server to suit your needs, including choosing the game you want to host, the number of players, and other settings.</p>
<p>Once your server is set up, playit.gg provides an IP address you can share with other players. This IP address is hosted on playit.gg's anycast network, ensuring that your server benefits from resilience, performance, and security offered 100% free by playit.gg.</p>
<h2>What do you get in the free tier?</h2>
<p>playit.gg offers both free and premium tiers, with the free tier offering up to 4 TCP ports, 4 UDP ports, and a single firewall. For users on IPv6 networks, playit.gg offers immense flexibility with the ability to use any or all of your 65,000+ public ports on your IP. Additional features like custom domains and dedicated IP addresses are available as add-ons.</p>
<h2>About DDoS Attacks and playit.gg</h2>
<p>In 2023, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become a significant threat to the online gaming industry, significantly reshaping its landscape. These attacks involve overwhelming a network, service, or server with internet traffic, causing it to slow down or crash. In the gaming context, these attacks target the game servers, disrupting the gaming experience for players and potentially leading to substantial financial losses for gaming companies.</p>
<p>The most direct impact of a DDoS attack on a gaming server is the disruption it causes to the players. Games may become laggy, disconnect frequently, or entirely inaccessible, significantly affecting players' gaming experience. A successful DDoS attack for gaming companies can result in substantial financial losses. These can stem from lost revenue during the attack, the cost of mitigating the attack, and potential compensation to affected players. Frequent or severe DDoS attacks can damage a gaming company’s reputation, losing the player base.</p>
<p>A service like playit.gg is acutely aware of the potential for DDoS attacks and has implemented measures to protect its users and maintain service quality. When you launch the playit program, the program will connect to playit.gg's Anycast Network and assign you a static IP and port. Your static IP and port can then be shared with friends. When they connect, their connection information will go to the nearest tunnel server and be tunneled to the playit program on your computer. By tunneling the connection, your friends can connect to the server running within your network.</p>
<h2>What is the best part about playit.gg</h2>
<p>One of the vital safety benefits of playit.gg is that it hides your IP, meaning that even if there is a DDoS attack, it won't affect your network. The service also lets you turn the "tunneling" off anytime by closing the program. Additionally, playit.gg features strong firewalls and better connection handling, further bolstering the service's resilience to DDoS attacks and other potential disruptions.</p>
<h2>Challenges of DDoS Protection in Playit.gg</h2>
<p>Despite the advantages of playit.gg's DDoS protection, some challenges come with it. One of the primary issues is the cost of maintaining a robust defense against DDoS attacks. In a message from Patrick, the founder and CEO of playit.gg, he acknowledges that the only viable way to handle these attacks is to invest more money in renting powerful servers. This could be a substantial expenditure, especially given the scale and frequency of the attacks.</p>
<h2>About DDoS in gaming</h2>
<p>The gaming industry is increasingly implementing measures to combat DDoS attacks. These include using DDoS protection services, educating players about DDoS attacks, and improving incident response capabilities. These measures aim to ensure the reliability and security of online gaming experiences and to minimize disruption to players​</p>

<h2><strong>Overview of the Security Breach</strong></h2>
<p>The CurseForge and Bukkit platforms, home to a multitude of Minecraft mods and plugins, have fallen victim to a massive cybersecurity breach. A substantial number of modpacks and mods, especially those on 1.16.5, 1.18.2, and 1.19.2 versions, were reportedly updated with malware. The unauthorized access to accounts and uploads of malicious files point towards a potential vulnerability in the Overwolf platform, which manages CurseForge and Bukkit.</p>
<h2><strong>Diving Deeper into the Malware</strong></h2>
<p>The malware was detected in mid-April and has since been injected into numerous popular plugins and mods. The affected accounts reportedly had two-factor authentication enabled, which suggests this isn't a simple password compromise but something potentially bigger on the CurseForge side.</p>
<p>The malware appears to extract Microsoft credentials and browser-saved passwords. We strongly advise all users to RESET ALL OF THEIR PASSWORDS after they have removed the virus.</p>
<h2><strong>Distribution</strong></h2>
<p>Some modpacks have had updates published for them without the authors' knowledge, adding a dependency on malicious mods. The malicious mods have uploaded dates multiple weeks in the past. DUE TO CURSE'S USAGE, a CDN compromise or cache poisoning is not out of the question. numbers, thus giving it a botnet-like behavior. It runs a command to execute a function to download the program again and save it as a self-running file. This malware has infiltrated numerous modpacks, and even with immediate archiving, these files might become accessible again later, exposing hundreds of thousands of players to malware.</p>
<p>The code execution mainly targets Linux users, possibly intending to infiltrate servers, but Windows users are not exempt from this threat. One particular file from this incident was not archived immediately and gained 10 downloads, implying it's possibly being disseminated through other platforms.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">As a precautionary measure, it is highly recommended to avoid updating any mods or modpacks until this threat is effectively neutralized.</p>
<h2><strong>Potential Impacts</strong></h2>
<p>The impacts could be extensive with the number of potentially compromised accounts and the malware's capability to extract sensitive information like saved passwords. Users risk losing control of their accounts or sensitive personal and financial data. The broader impact on the Minecraft modding community is also severe, with the potential for widespread mistrust and uncertainty.</p>
<h2>The Iris Project's Statement</h2>
<p>The Iris Project, another prominent player in the Minecraft modding community, has also voiced its concerns about the issue. The project's team states that they believe numerous accounts on CurseForge have been compromised and are being used to upload malicious files containing bot-nets. They have assured their user base that they are actively investigating the situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">"We have reason to believe many accounts on CurseForge have been hacked and are uploading malicious files containing bot-nets. Luna Pixel Studios, the owner of many big modpacks, is one of the affected accounts. The situation is being actively looked into."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What Do We Learn</h2>
<p>The CurseForge and Bukkit breach has brought the importance of cybersecurity to the forefront once again. It serves as a reminder of the persistent threats in the digital landscape. As we await the resolution of the issue, it's critical to stay vigilant, ensuring we take steps to protect our data and systems from potential threats.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant, perform regular checks on your system, and keep an eye out for updates on this situation. Remember, your cybersecurity is in your hands!</p>

<p>With FiveM, players can create their dedicated servers and modify various aspects of the game, including adding new maps, vehicles, scripts, and game modes. It provides a platform for developers to build and share their custom multiplayer game modes, role-playing servers, and other creative content.</p>
<p>FiveM is widely used for role-playing servers. These role-playing servers often have rules and communities, offering a unique multiplayer experience. Players take on different roles and engage in activities such as police enforcement, emergency services, criminal enterprises, or simply interacting with other players in a virtual world.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that FiveM is a third-party modification and operates separately from the official GTA Online servers. It is not endorsed or supported by Rockstar Games. Still, it has gained significant popularity among the GTA V community due to its versatility and ability to create customized multiplayer environments.</p>
<h2>About the FiveM Asset Escrow Protection System</h2>
<p>The FiveM Asset Escrow Protection System, developed in collaboration with <a href="https://Tebex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tebex</a>, offers a secure solution for resource authors within the FiveM community. Instead of relying on obfuscation or IP locking, this system encrypts resources and ensures purchase ownership. Authors can protect their code from leaks and unauthorized usage by uploading their zipped resources to the Keymaster 4.0k dashboard. <br>Tebex is the exclusive monetization partner, allowing creators to link their FiveM Assets directly to Tebex packages.<br>Customers who purchase content receive a download link and access management is handled through the keymaster dashboard. <br>This system provides an alternative that avoids performance slowdowns and security concerns associated with traditional protection methods. It encourages collaboration and open-source practices while offering resource developers control over their code and assets.</p>
<h2>So where is the security issue</h2>
<p>The security issue arises when downloading files from the Cfx.re Keymaster. Upon downloading a file, you can inspect its properties to find the "Where from" information, which reveals the original URL of the downloaded file. In the case of the Cfx.re Keymaster, the URL structure is similar to the following example:</p>
<pre><a href="https://content.cfx.re/assets/:asset-id/61e009eea9ffc702734527f676bf26e7?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%20%3D%22andrada.zip%22&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=asset-storage%2F20230513%2Fcfx%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20230513T150508Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=a50608224a501bee0e39447ad5bbbc97b1948c27fbe7ef23f476bbdb1fa20295" target="_new">content.cfx.re/assets/:asset-id/61e009eea9ffc702734527f676bf26e7?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%20%3D%22andrada.zip%22&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=asset-storage%2F2023%2Fcfx%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20230513T150508Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=a50608224a501bee0e39447ad5bbbc97b1948c27fbe7ef23f476bbdb1fa</a></pre>

                <p>Embarking on the journey of creating complex automation can seem thrilling and intimidating. However, crafting advanced automation becomes a smooth and proficient process with the right approach and tools.</p>
<h2>An Introduction to n8n</h2>
<p>n8n is a robust, open-source workflow automation tool that empowers users to synchronize, automate, and coordinate tasks across a multitude of applications. Representing "nodemation," n8n operates on the concept of nodes, which signify individual tasks or operations. Linking these nodes allows one to create various workflows, effectively bridging the gap between numerous services such as databases, APIs, and software applications. This makes n8n an incredibly versatile tool, equipped to handle anything from simple tasks to intricate business processes. Its intuitive interface and a vast library of pre-built nodes for various applications allow even non-coders to design and execute effective automation workflows. Moreover, the open-source nature of n8n fosters a community-driven approach, inviting users to contribute and enhance the platform constantly.</p>
<h2>A Comprehensive 5-Step Guide to Advanced Automation</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Build a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS)</h3>
<p>The initial step in crafting advanced automation involves developing a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS). This essentially means building the simplest possible solution to your problem. The objective isn't to create the perfect or most complex solution immediately but to understand the situation thoroughly and devise a solution that effectively tackles it.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Identify and Address Edge Cases</h3>
<p>Edge cases, situations occurring at extreme operating parameters, often present significant challenges in software development. Proactively addressing these potential anomalies enhances the robustness and reliability of your automation.</p>
<p>When dealing with edge cases, remember to take into account factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diverse input formats</li>
<li>Potential updates that could affect your automation</li>
<li>Scalability issues</li>
<li>Future requests that could alter the functionality</li>
<li>How empty fields are handled</li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying and addressing these potential pitfalls beforehand can help mitigate the emergence of bugs in the future.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Test with Mock Data</h3>
<p>Never deploy your automation to a production environment without extensive testing, mainly if it's critical to your business. A good practice is to use mock data for testing your workflows. You can generate and manipulate fake data using resources like mockaroo[.]com or the AI model, ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Remember, discovering an issue during testing is a success as it means you've found a potential problem before it can cause actual harm. The key is to resolve it before rolling out your automation.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Remove Redundancies</h3>
<p>The primary aim of automation is to boost efficiency and productivity. Consequently, it's vital to identify and eliminate any redundancies in your workflows. For instance, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are any actions being repeated?</li>
<li>Are these actions already included in another workflow?</li>
<li>Can this part of the workflow be reused elsewhere?</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these points allows you to create sub-automation that streamline your workflows, saving time and enhancing work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Document and Report</h3>
<p>You might not remember the purpose or function of every part of your complex automation. Many developers tend to build workflows in isolation, which can cause issues in the long run. What if you need to onboard someone, fall ill, or leave the company?</p>
<p>Hence, it's crucial to document your workflows clearly and descriptively. Assign clear names to your workflows, provide general descriptions, and give specific explanations for each part of your automation.</p>
<p>Additionally, ensure to set up reporting for any failures. A dedicated channel (like a Slack channel named 'n8n-errors') can assist you in quickly identifying and rectifying issues.</p>
<p>In summary, the 5-step process for building advanced automation on n8n consists of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building a Minimum Viable Solution (MVS)</li>
<li>Identifying and addressing edge cases</li>
<li>Testing with mock data</li>
<li>Removing redundancies</li>
<li>Documenting and reporting</li>
</ol>
<p>Embrace this guide as a roadmap to navigate the complexities of automation, transforming daunting tasks into achievable goals.</p>

<p>In May 2017, the world was plunged into digital chaos by a widespread cyberattack known as WannaCry. Within the blink of an eye, this devastating ransomware attack spread across the globe, infecting over 200,000 computers in 150 countries.</p>

<h3>Unraveling the WannaCry Ransomware Attack</h3>
<p>WannaCry's potency stemmed from its ability to spread rapidly. The ransomware exploited a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, which, while Microsoft had patched, many computers were still vulnerable due to not having updated their systems. This allowed WannaCry to spread from computer to computer without user interaction, encrypting files and demanding a ransom payment in Bitcoin to decrypt them.</p>
<p>The impact of WannaCry was significant and global. Hundreds of hospitals were forced to cancel appointments and surgeries, and patient care was significantly compromised. Hospitals, businesses, and government agencies were all affected, with the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) experiencing particularly devastating consequences.</p>
<p>In economic terms, the repercussions were equally severe. WannaCry reportedly cost the global economy billions of dollars, making it one of the most destructive cyberattacks.</p>
<h3>The Harrowing Aftermath: A Global Wake-Up Call</h3>
<p>WannaCry served as a loud wake-up call, illustrating the world's vulnerability to cyberattacks and the speed at which they can propagate. It compelled governments and businesses to take critical steps toward improving their cybersecurity infrastructure.</p>
<h3>WannaCry and the NHS: A Case Study</h3>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) bore the brunt of the WannaCry ransomware attack. Hundreds of hospitals were compelled to cancel appointments and surgeries, and some patients were even turned away from emergency rooms. Financial losses for the NHS mounted to an estimated £92 million.</p>
<p>In response to WannaCry's damaging effects, the NHS has implemented measures to bolster its cybersecurity. However, as ransomware attacks grow increasingly sophisticated, the need for continual vigilance and proactive cybersecurity measures remains paramount.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Ransomware: A Growing Threat</h3>
<p>While WannaCry is a notable instance, it's merely one of many examples of a ransomware attack. Ransomware, a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment for their decryption, has existed for many years. However, these attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and targeted, shifting from individuals to businesses and organizations.</p>
<h3>Protecting Yourself from Ransomware: A Guide</h3>
<p>Given the growing threat of ransomware, it's crucial to take steps to protect your digital assets:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your software updated.</strong> Regular software updates often include security patches, which protect your computer from vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Use a strong password manager.</strong> This tool helps you create and store robust, unique passwords for all your online accounts.</li>

        <content type="html">
            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://blog.thefourcraft.com/media/posts/39/Is-AI-Panic-Justified.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field that has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. However, some people are concerned that AI could threaten humanity. Is this fear justified?</p>

<h2 id="potential-risks-of-ai">Potential Risks of AI</h2>
<p>There are certainly some potential risks associated with AI. For example, AI could be used to develop autonomous weapons systems that could kill without human intervention. AI could also create mass surveillance systems that could track our every move. In addition, AI could be used to create deep fakes, videos, or audio recordings manipulated to make it appear that someone is saying or doing something they never actually said or did.</p>
<h2 id="potential-benefits-of-ai">Potential Benefits of AI</h2>
<p>However, there are also many potential benefits to AI. For example, AI could be used to develop new medical treatments, improve our understanding of the universe, and create new forms of art and entertainment. AI could also be used to automate tasks that are currently done by humans, which could free up our time to focus on more creative and fulfilling pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-the-risks-and-benefits">Balancing the Risks and Benefits</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the question of whether or not AI is a threat to humanity is a complex one. AI has potential risks and benefits, and weighing these carefully before making any judgments is essential.</p>
<p>One way to mitigate the risks of AI is through regulation. Governments and other organizations could develop rules that govern the development and use of AI. These regulations could help to ensure that AI is used safely and ethically.</p>
<p>For example, regulations could prohibit the development of autonomous weapons systems that could kill without human intervention. Codes could also require that AI systems be transparent so that we can understand how they work and ensure they are not being used to discriminate against or harm people.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-regulation-in-ensuring-safe-and-ethical-ai">The Role of Regulation in Ensuring Safe and Ethical AI</h2>
<p>Regulation is not a perfect solution, but it can help mitigate AI risks and ensure that this powerful technology is used for good. By developing and enforcing regulations that govern the development and use of AI, governments and other organizations can balance the risks and benefits associated with AI, ensuring that it is used safely and ethically.</p>
<h2>AI Bias and Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>Another essential aspect to consider when discussing AI's potential threats is bias and ethical considerations. AI systems are often trained on large datasets, and if these datasets contain preferences, the AI system may inadvertently perpetuate and even amplify those biases. This could lead to discriminatory practices, as AI systems are increasingly used in hiring, lending, and medical diagnostics.</p>
<p>Researchers and developers must ensure that AI systems are trained on diverse and representative datasets to address this issue. Moreover, ethical guidelines should be established to ensure that AI is developed and used in a manner that respects human rights and values and that the potential negative impacts of AI on marginalized or vulnerable populations are minimized.</p>
<h2>AI and Job Displacement</h2>
<p>The increasing automation of jobs due to AI advancements raises concerns about job displacement and unemployment. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they may be able to perform tasks previously thought to be the exclusive domain of humans. This could lead to significant job losses in specific industries and require reevaluating the labor market and workforce development strategies.</p>
<p>Governments, businesses, and educational institutions should prepare for these changes by investing in workforce retraining and reskilling programs. Additionally, the development of policies to ensure that the benefits of AI-driven economic growth are distributed equitably among all members of society will be crucial.</p>
<h2>AI and Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>The widespread use of AI also raises privacy concerns, as AI systems often require access to large amounts of personal data to function effectively. This can lead to potential abuses of this data and a loss of privacy for individuals.</p>
<p>To mitigate these concerns, strong data privacy regulations should be implemented to protect the personal information of individuals. Additionally, the development of privacy-preserving AI techniques, such as federated learning and differential privacy, can help ensure that AI systems can still function effectively without compromising the privacy of individuals.</p>
<h2>The Importance of AI Literacy and Public Engagement</h2>
<p>As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the general public must develop a basic understanding of AI technologies and their potential implications. This will enable people to make informed decisions about the use of AI in their lives and to participate in democratic processes related to AI regulation and governance.</p>
<p>Educational institutions, governments, and private organizations should work together to promote AI literacy and ensure that the public is engaged in discussions about the development and use of AI. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns, educational programs, and opportunities for public input in developing AI regulations and policies.</p>

                <p>If you're running a FiveM server, you know how important it is to secure it from potential threats. One way to do this is using a <a href="https://blog.thefourcraft.com/the-fall-of-vpn-and-the-rise-of-zero-trust/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero-trust security model</a>, where you can only access the server through a secure channel.</p>

<p class="msg msg--highlight ">This guide isn't for beginners. I assume you know "how to operate a FiveM server," and you have a Cloudflare account and access to the Cloudflare ZTNA.</p>
<h2>What is Cloudflared Tunnel?</h2>
<p>Cloudflared Tunnel is a secure, encrypted tunnel between your server and Cloudflare's network. It allows you to securely access your server from anywhere without exposing it to the internet. Cloudflared Tunnel is part of the Cloudflare Workers family of products, using the same security and privacy features as Cloudflare Workers.</p>
<h2>Setting up Cloudflared Tunnel</h2>
<p>To set up Cloudflared Tunnel, you'll need a Cloudflare account and access to the server you want to secure.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Cloudflared on your server. You can find instructions on installing Cloudflared on the ZTNA Dashboard or <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new Tunnel in the Cloudflare ZTNA dashboard. <br>Give it a name and select the server that you want to secure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Integrating with FiveM</h2>
<p>We'll use a reverse proxy to integrate your FiveM server with Cloudflared Tunnel.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a route for your FiveM server using the HTTP protocol in the Cloudflare ZTNA dashboard. The route should look something like this: <code>http://localhost:30120.</code> </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="msg msg--info">Sometimes I needed to change the settings on the cloudflared tunnel to do the SLL work with the cre.fx server listing ping/API. It's recommended to change the proxy type to socks</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up a <a href="https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/proxy-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reverse proxy for your FiveM server</a>. The reverse proxy should listen on port 443 and forward requests to the connecting endpoint specified in the route.</p>
<pre class="p1">// prevents the server list from advertising your server using its actual IP<br>set sv_forceIndirectListing true<br><br>// makes the server list backend request `https://server1.example.com/` instead of the default<br>set sv_listingHostOverride "server1.example.com"<br><br>// a space-separated list of IPv4 networks in CIDR notation to allow 'X-Real-IP'<br>// from, as well as bypass the rate limiter<br>set sv_proxyIPRanges "100.64.1.1/32"<br><br>// the actual endpoint your server is hosted on, or one<br>// or multiple server endpoint proxies, as noted below<br>set sv_endpoints "100.64.1.2:30120"<br><br>// Some guides also mention `sv_listingIpOverride.` This value is only needed<br>// if the server list backend can't guess the IP to query itself and is not provided to any front-end connection.<br>// This is usually the case for systems with multiple IPs or if the server is firewalled off for all hosts except<br>// a server proxy.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to configure your reverse proxy to use SSL encryption. You can obtain an SSL certificate from Cloudflare or a trusted certificate authority.</p>
</li>
<li>Test your connection!</li>
</ol>
<p class="msg msg--warning">It's important to note that some regions may experience higher ping when using Cloudflared Tunnel because it was not built explicitly for game servers. Instead, it was designed to securely expose websites or other networks that don't require a low ping to operate, such as websites or web applications.</p>
<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>we are using Cloudflare tunnel to secure more than 150+ applications and websites! </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using Cloudflared Tunnel, you can create a secure, encrypted connection between your FiveM server and Cloudflare's network. This will help protect your server from potential threats and give you peace of mind knowing that your server is secure. Contact the Cloudflare support team if you have any questions or need help setting up Cloudflared Tunnel.</p>
